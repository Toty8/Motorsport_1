A dinamic section which shows the last 5 published articles and arrows so that you can see the next or the previous one. By clicking on the article`s title you are redirected the article itself.

* Articles page -> 
A page which visualise all (non deleted) articles that have ever been published, ordered by publish date in descending order. A button with text "Details" is giving you access to read the article. The articles also can be filtered or paged by you.

* Article page-> 
A simple page visualising the article itself, full details about it and a comment section which you can read. While reading the article you are probebly going to notice two buttons "Like" and " Add Comment". They do exactly what you think they are going to do, but as soon as you click them they are going to redirect you to the login page because you are not authenticated. 

* Drivers page->

You have to choose one driver and one team while staying under the budget.It is going sum the driver and the team championship points, and every dollar that is left unused it is going to add 5 points to the result. After that you are added to the standing(which is the page you are currently on) and it shows at which position you are placed. And to start playing you just have to press the "Draft" button.

## Admin part

This part of the platform is designed for the admin. These user have access to the following:

* Home page -> 
  This page have nothing in common with the other home page. This one is part of the admin area. It visualise four buttons. The first two of them are "Add Team" and "Add Driver". But keep in mind that you wont be able to add team If there are already 10 active teams(team is active when it have two drivers) and you wont be able add new driver there are already 20 active drivers(driver is active when he have a team and the team have two drivers).Also do not forget that a team with only one driver is not considered as an active team.
  When you click on "Add driver" you will be redirected to a page where you can add a driver who has already raced in Formula 1(this way we do not have to reset his statistics). But if you want you can also add a driver who has never raced in Formula 1 by clicking on the "Add new driver" button. On the add new driver page you are going to see a "Add old driver" button which is going to redirect you to the add old driver page(last page).
  When you click on "Add team" you will be redirected to a page where you can add a team which has never raced in Formula 1. But if you want you can also add a team who has alredy raced in Formula 1 by clicking on the "here" link(this way we do not have to reset it statistics). The link is going to redirect you to add old driver page because as you have read earlier a team is active only when it have two drivers.
  The button "Add publish" gives you an oppotunity to add an alredy existing user to a role publisher.
  "All users" button gives a table information about all the users that are registered in the site such is full name, email, information if they are agents, publishers or if they are online.

* Articles page ->

* Teams page-> 
The same as before, but you will have access to "Edit" and "Unactivate" buttons, which will help you edit team pesonal information such as team name and photo and unactivate team(setting team to be inactive). The two buttons will also be accessible in the team`s details.

* Standing page-> 
  The same as before, but with two new buttons. One of them is "Add result".It is personal for every driver and it redirect you to add result page. Where you are supposed to enter the position which the driver finished the race and if he had achieved the pole position or the fastest lap of the race. Ones you enter the information the site is going to calculate different race statistics about the driver such as wins, pole positions, points, podiums and ect. Entering the information once the site also update information about the team which is the reason why there is no such a button for the teams.
  The other button is "Reset (End Championship)" which is going to reset both driver and team standing(seting all drivers and teams point to 0) and add one more championship to both the first driver and the first team in there championships. Also it is going to delete every draft made in the draft standing.
  
* Draft page->

## About The Project - Technical Description


### Built With

* [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
* [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server)

## Special Thanks

* For the develepment of this project a really want to thank [Kristiyan Ivanov](https://github.com/KrIsKa7a) and [Stamo Petrov](https://github.com/Stamo).
* For the AutoMapper functionality I used a [template](https://github.com/NikolayIT/ASP.NET-Core-Template/tree/master/src/Services/AspNetCoreTemplate.Services.Mapping) from [Nikolay Kostov](https://github.com/NikolayIT)

## Pre-App Launch Setup

Before you start using your app, do a quick setup. In the "Manage user secrets" add:

{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server={YourServer};Database=Motorsport1;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}

. In The package manager console, type "update-datebase" so that you can add the database and seed the data. It is really important to run the package manager console in "Motorsport/Data", because thats where are the migrations folder is. 

As you start the project there will already be seeded two users with roles:

* "Admin@admin.com" - admin role

* "Publisher@publisher.com" - publisher role
  
* Both have password: 123456
